== Summary

A process manager which watches processes, feeds them configurations, tells them what to do, and wipes schmutz off their faces.

It's fully compatible with djb's "daemontools" process manager (aka. svscan).

== To try it out:

  $ ruby babysitter.rb test-system
   
== Required Ruby gems:

  * eventmachine
  * file-tail
